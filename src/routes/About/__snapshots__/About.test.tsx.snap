      Friday Poetry
    </h1>
    <p>
      Friday poetry was started by Dan in the MakerSquare alumni Slack Channel (MakerSquare was a immersive programming course that no longer exists). Every week, people were encouraged to extend their creative power, and write some poetry! I enjoyed doing this because it stretched parts of my brain that I don't use on a regular basis. In fact, I enjoyed doing this so much, I decided to make it into a website.
