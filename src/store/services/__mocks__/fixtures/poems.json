      "text": "In England once there lived a big\nA wonderfully clever pig.\nTo everybody it was plain\nThat Piggy had a massive brain.\nHe worked out sums inside his head,\nThere was no book he hadn't read.\nHe knew what made an airplane fly,\nHe knew how engines worked and why.\nHe knew all this, but in the end\nOne question drove him round the bend:\nHe simply couldn't puzzle out\nWhat LIFE was really all about.\n\nWhat was the reason for his birth?\nWhy was he placed upon this earth?\nHis giant brain went round and round.\nAlas, no answer could be found.\nTill suddenly one wondrous night.\nAll in a flash he saw the light.\nHe jumped up like a ballet dancer\nAnd yelled, \"By gum, I've got the answer!\"\n\"They want my bacon slice by slice\n\"To sell at a tremendous price!\n\"They want my tender juicy chops\n\"To put in all the butcher's shops!\n\"They want my pork to make a roast\n\"And that's the part'll cost the most!\n\"They want my sausages in strings!\n\"They even want my chitterlings!\n\"The butcher's shop! The carving knife!\n\"That is the reason for my life!\"\n\nSuch thoughts as these are not designed\nTo give a pig great peace of mind.\nNext morning, in comes Farmer Bland,\nA pail of pigswill in his hand,\nAnd piggy with a mighty roar,\nBashes the farmer to the floor…\nNow comes the rather grizzly bit\nSo let's not make too much of it,\nExcept that you must understand\nThat Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,\nHe ate him up from head to toe,\nChewing the pieces nice and slow.\nIt took an hour to reach the feet,\nBecause there was so much to eat,\nAnd when he finished, Pig, of course,\nFelt absolutely no remorse.\n\nSlowly he scratched his brainy head\nAnd with a little smile he said,\n\"I had a fairly powerful hunch\n\"That he might have me for his lunch.\n\"And so, because I feared the worst,\n\"I thought I'd better eat him first.\""

      "text": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference."
