# Friday Poetry

Friday poetry was started by Dan in the MakerSquare alumni Slack Channel
(MakerSquare was a immersive programming course that no longer exists). Every
week, people were encouraged to extend their creative power, and write some
poetry! I enjoyed doing this because it stretched parts of my brain that I don't
use on a regular basis. In fact, I enjoyed doing this so much, I decided to make
it into a website. Here it is!
