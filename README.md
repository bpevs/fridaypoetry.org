Friday Poetry
=============
![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivebencrazy/fridaypoetry.org.svg?branch=master)

Friday poetry was started by Dan in the MakerSquare alumni Slack Channel (MakerSquare was a immersive programming course that no longer exists). Every week, people were encouraged to extend their creative power, and write some poetry! I enjoyed doing this because it stretched parts of my brain that I don't use on a regular basis. In fact, I enjoyed doing this so much, I decided to make it into a website. Here it is!
