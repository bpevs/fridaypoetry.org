I do not care at all, Mr. BunBun said.
I do not care for spring or fall,
I do not care when crows do call.
I do not care for muffin crumbs,
I do not care when winter comes.
I do not care if you leave that here.
I do not carrot all.

Litany Fitany was just such a gal
She never could skip on an old-fashioned howl.
She liked to spell her name wrong at the 'bucks,
Just to be mad, and use all her "shucks"
She finally met her match this week,
When manning the bar was Nona Ursheet
